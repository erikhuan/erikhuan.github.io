summary: My YouTube channel.

This is my gaming YouTube channel. Through making livestream videos I hope to be able to improve my communcation skills by being able to make conversation with an audience that isn't necessarily always there.

Another term for the kind of videos that I make is called "Let's Plays". These types of videos involve the player recording their playthrough of the game they are playing. These videos are normally accompanied by commentary as to keep the audience more engaged with not just the video, but the player himself. Below I've included one of my recent videos playing through a section of Assassin's Creed Syndicate.
