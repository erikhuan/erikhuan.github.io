## Description

This is my gaming YouTube channel. Through making livestream videos I hope to be able to improve my communcation skills by being able to make conversation with an audience that isn't necessarily always there.

Another term for the kind of videos that I make is called "Let's Plays". These types of videos involve the player recording their playthrough of the game they are playing. These videos are normally accompanied by commentary as to keep the audience more engaged with not just the video, but the player himself.

## What I Do

Below I've included one of my recent videos playing through a section of Assassin's Creed Syndicate. If you would like to see more feel free to check out my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVor_a0Czn-3QzytiYLRQWg">YouTube channel</a> or click the link at the bottom.

## So Far

Streaming my playthroughs has been something I've been wanting to get around to since "Let's Plays" began to get popular. However, I did not have any proper equipment or software to record my gameplay until I purchased a PS4. Sony's console has a built in Share feature that allows users to easily record or livestream their gameplay. With this all I have to do is push and button and start playing. It has really made it easy to do these livestream videos and I hope I'll get enough footage to maybe compile a "Best of" video or something similar in the future.
