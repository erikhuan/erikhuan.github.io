summary: The goal of the Manoa Flea Market is to provide a UH based market system that allowed students and faculty to buy and sell their items.

## Our Goal

When you go to an actual flea market it is held at a venue where there are sellers displaying their wares. The Manoa Flea Market was to be a literal online flea market for students and faculty registered under the UH system. Users could edit their profile and add listings for other users to see. When exploring the website you can either visit the Market to look and filter through all items, view Contacts to see all available users, or visit another user's profile to see all items they are selling.

## The Website

Creating this website was much more difficult than I initially.
