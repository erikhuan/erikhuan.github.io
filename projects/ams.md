## What is AMS?

The Anime Manga Society (AMS) is a social club on the University of Hawaii at Manoa campus that normally hosts meetings every Thursday and Friday. They try to create a safe environment for people to share their joy of anime with one another. Feel free to visit the 
<a href="http://animemangasociety.com/">AMS Website</a> or their <a href="https://www.facebook.com/AMSManoa/?ref=bookmarks">Facebook page</a> for more details about the club.

## What am I to AMS?

I found out about AMS through a dear friend who is no longer with us. It was my first semester at UH Manoa. I was getting used to the campus and just hanging out with the couple of friends that were with me from high school. Then sometime later I was invited to come check out the AMS club. Being part of a similar club back in high school, the secretary no less, I was interested to see what the club was like. That semester they were in Kuykendall Room 307 I think. It was nice and cold as I was lugging a bunch of art supplies for a class I was attending. I just quietly walked into the classroom as the members were already in the middle of their showings. I sat down and just watched along with everyone else. When it was over I was greeted by the club president who happily welcomed me. Over time I got to know the members better and soon enough that was my Thrusday and Friday evenings. A few years later some members have left because they have graduated and some officer positions needed to be filled. I was nominated to be the next club president, but the former president was still around to manage things. After a year my classes started to take up more of my time and I slowly started going to the meetings less and less. Now the club has new members and have their own event called the Manoa Otaku Experience (MOE).

## So Far

Through AMS I made new friends and found a volunteer job that has now become my current part-time employment for over 3 years now. Being a former officer I learned how officer meetings worked, how event planning is done, and how to work with others in managing a club as far as this club is concerned.
