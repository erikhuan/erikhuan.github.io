Snurts are resilient creatures that adapt to nearly any environment. Here is a gif of its moving animation that I made.

This is one of many enemies I plan on making and designing to implement in my metroidvania game that I'm trying to develop in my free time.

##Story

For those who do not know what I mean when I say "metroidvania" the term is derived from two game titles: Metroid and Castlevania. It is a subgenre of action-adventure games that generally have a large interconnected world map that players can explore. Power-ups, collectables, and other tools are hidden across the world that players can find to help them in their quest.

My game takes place in a fictional medieval kingdom where the player is a young boy enlisted as a squire for the protection of the town. Throughout the game the player will meet other squires that are on missions like yourself to keep the kingdom safe. Halfway through the game, based on the actions the player has taken he will be shifted into one of two paths that lead to opposing endings. I hope that players will find their first playthrough unique to them and hope they try to replay the game for the other ending.

You can check out my public GitHub repository <a href="https://github.com/erikhuan/myGame">here</a> and follow the work I've done so far. If you are interested in giving suggestions or offering your help or support feel free to e-mail me.
