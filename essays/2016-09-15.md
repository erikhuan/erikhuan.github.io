I started learning about GitHub around a year ago. It's an amazing site that is hosting this page and allows people to collaborate on large projects that involve coding. The fact that you can work on a portion of code and return later to see progress on it sounds amazing. But not everyone has the same coding styles or even thought process.

When I was learning GitHub I had, and still have, trouble figuring out how to get pull requests properly. My partner and I were working on a simple website and we were confused on how to get our code to push through to each other. Sometimes the code worked and we could see changes to the website, but most of the time nothing really happened. It was a bit frustrating and I don't quite remember what we did to get the website finished in the end. I'm hoping that by the end of my ICS 314 experience I'll have a much better grasp of using GitHub.

Because of my recent knowledge of GitHub I was not aware that people had other ways to manage their own code say through DropBox. I think GitHub is nice because you can store your repositories onto the website and you can look at it from another computer and edit it from there. Git on the other hand being a local only thing, while I don't have a lot of experience with it, one thing I can say is that being able to view your past commits is pretty useful if you want to find out where something went wrong in your code. The shell command "git diff" is useful for comparing code to find the differences in them.
