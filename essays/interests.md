## Why am I an ICS Major

I decided to become an ICS major for a simple reason, I want to make video games. While the major itself offers many job opportunities, I the wanting to make games is my driving force. I want to be able to learn how to make those amazing games that I spent so much of my childhood playing, the excitement of starting a new adventure, how it all boils down to lines of code and artwork. I want to be able to make games that people can enjoy playing by themselves or with others. Something that kids who grew up playing them will look back at with fond memories. As long as there are people that are happy playing something I made, I can be proud at what I've done.

## What do I Know

So far in the time I have spent learning computer science I have learned that math and physics are very important tools that will dictate how most game related code will function. I have learned a handful of coding languages such as Java and C, as well as other languages I may not necessarily ever use like Lisp or Java. I've learned how to make a website and how database systems work. I've learned a bit how games are built such as action states and sprite sheets and an idea of how all a games code should be organized.

## What I Hope to Learn

As of this writing I'm slowly trying to learn Unity in my free time. I also hope to learn more about how to develop and improve websites and learn about other open source programs that can help me make video games. By the end of 2017 I hope to improve my skills as a game developer whether it is through coding  or artwork.
