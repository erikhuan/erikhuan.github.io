## Why Use a UI Framework?

The impact of using a UI framework when developing a website could mean the difference of having a Windows 95 interface to a Windows 10's.

<div class="ui small rounded images">
  <img class="ui image" src="../images/windows95.jpg">
</div>
<div class="ui small rounded images">
  <img class="ui image" src="../images/windows10.png">
</div>

Simply put, raw css and html can only get you so far when making an attractive website. Using a framework gives the programmer an easier time developing a webpage at the cost of needing to learn said framework; and there are a lot of different frameworks out there. However, all these different frameworks are maybe 80~90% similar so learning the first one is a big step that will open the door to many other frameworks.

## Bootstrap

My first framework that I learned was Bootstrap. I never really went into depth with the language, but what I did learn from using it was how easy it was to make columns on pages and just structuring the layout in general. Bootstrap allowed me to make simple webpages that were responsive to how large the screen size was for the user. If the user shrank their window the webpage would accomodate for the size and rearrange the contents on the page to fit the window.
