Writing JavaScript has been for the most part fairly simply and straight forward in coding. Prior to this
class I have had some JavaScripting experience already, so performing the freecodecamp.com JavaScript
exercises was a good refresher as to how I should be coding. During the exercises I did learn to do a few
things that I did not know how prior such as learning about the Strict Equality Operator and shift/unshift
functions.
```
3 === 3   // true
3 === '3' // false
```
```
// Example
var ourArray = ["Stimpson", "J", "cat"];
ourArray.shift(); // ourArray now equals ["J", "cat"]
ourArray.unshift("Happy"); 
// ourArray now equals ["Happy", "J", "cat"]

// Setup
var myArray = [["John", 23], ["dog", 3]];
myArray.shift();
// myArray now equals [["dog", 3]]
// Only change code below this line.

myArray.unshift(["Paul", 35]);
// myArray is now [["Paul", 35],["dog", 3]]
```
So far with my experience with JavaScript I think it is a good programming language because it is easy to
learn and use. There are also efficient ways to write your code as I have learned from the Airbnb JavaScript
Style Guide https://github.com/airbnb/javascript.

As for the practice WODs, they are certainly useful. If I find myself taking too long on a piece of code
then I definitely should be looking for help on understanding it. The video showing the solution is very
helpful because even if I did successfully write the code in a reasonable amount of time, it may not be
the same way the video coded the solution. This gives me a different perspective of the problem and helps
me to be a better programmer. Although still too early to tell, the WODs are not very stressful yet, but I
can imagine them being much more difficult in the future.
